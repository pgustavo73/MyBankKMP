# MyBank App 

This is a multiplatform app that runs on both iOS and Android. I built it as part of my learning journey, where I explored backend development using Kotlin and Spring Boot to create a simple banking REST API. Then, I developed a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) app that consumes this API, combining frontend and backend knowledge in a single project.

Through this project, I significantly deepened my understanding of Kotlin, KMP, and RESTful API

Technologies: 

- Kotlin
- MVI
- Jetpac Compose
- KMP
- Ktor

Feel free to look, I am open to tips and suggestions.
